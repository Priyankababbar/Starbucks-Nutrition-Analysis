# Starbucks-Nutrition-Analysis
This Dashboard contains the nutrition info for Starbucks menu items.

I have used different visuals, slicers and cards for better data analysis.

We can see essential information for individuals beverages for monitoring the fat intake for health or dietary reasons which includes, Total Calorie intake, Carbs, sodium, Total Fat (g), 'Trans Fat (g)', 'Saturated Fat (g), Sugar, 'Cholesterol (mg)' etc.

Some visuals are representing the Average caffeine and Vitamins by each Beverage Category.

one can choose the beverage and see the nutrition details by choosing different cup sizes.

This Dashboard serves as a comprehensive guide to the nutritional content of Starbucks beverages, making it a valuable resource for researchers, dietitians, and health-conscious consumers.
